# Getting Started with LINs Lab
This document should provide useful information to newcomers to get familiar with LINs Lab.
**Please help us improve the doc and keep it updated!**

## General rules
* There are no lab regulations regarding research time or location, once you are making steady progress. 
  However, in order to maintain a conducive environment for health research, please try to allocate a sufficient amount of time in the lab each working day.
* It is *YOUR responsibility* to `push` yourself (and your supervisors), via efficient communication and collaboration strategies.
* We do open-source, transparent research and please always use our group's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lins-lab). Please use GitHub as the main collaborative platform for research projects in the lab, i.e., please always push the latest source files (e.g., codes, latex files), meeting notes, etc, to the GitHub repo.
* Please aim to maintain a healthy work-life balance as well as physical fitness. Some deadline days may be exempt :)
* The lab will have one group meeting and 1-on-1 research meetings per week (at least during the semester).
  * The group meeting starts with a round-table discussion (each uses 3 min to briefly describe the progress per month; please check more [details](https://github.com/LINs-lab/group_meeting_round_table_recording) here), followed by a formal research presentation (in English) by one group member.
  * Each group member takes a turn during the semester to give a 45 min - 1 h research talk presentation. Arbitrary research topics are welcome.
  * The link to the schedule of the group meeting can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RxBtcdmfrM9kVn9bACpr6hmk7CbJLwa-0KAdCtXnqqo/edit?usp=sharing). Please switch yourself with your colleagues if you are not available for a presentation.
  * The 1-on-1 research meeting (between PI and the group member) normally would last for 30 min-60 min (either English or Chinese), and at least once a week (depending on the group member). The group member should have English presentation slides prepared beforehand, using the template provided [here](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides/tree/main/lab_templates/latex_slides). Please also check [the advice on efficient communication](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides#communication).
* Authorship. For the *main research project conducted/completed in the LINs lab*, please confirm with your official advisor (e.g., your Ph.D. supervisor) that:
  1. PI Tao LIN should be the last author for any lab projects he contributed.
      * Otherwise, only some suggestions/discussions will be provided. The following items, regarding, e.g., (1) research idea, (2) writing, and (3) etc, cannot be guaranteed.
  2. PI Tao LIN by default will be the corresponding author for any lab projects he contributed. 
      * For some rare cases, negotiation may be required; however, a footnote must be included on the front page to specify the locality/status of the key authors when finishing the lab project.
  3. In a multiple-author paper, the order and annotation are determined by the amount of contribution.
  4. Lab members have the freedom to do side projects. 
  Such projects are not necessary to be related/belong to the lab (once it is the case, then no authorship requirement), but please ensure steady progress on the lab project.
* [Regulations for Ph.D. student](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides/blob/main/regulations_phd.md)
* [Some rules from Westlake University](./materials/%E8%A5%BF%E6%B9%96%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0%E4%B8%8E%E6%8E%A8%E7%90%86%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%AE%9E%E9%AA%8C%E5%AE%A4%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%8A%9E%E6%B3%95%EF%BC%88%E8%AF%95%E8%A1%8C%EF%BC%89.pdf)

## Communication and collaboration
We recommend using one email for all, namely, Slack, Gmail, and Github.

* [Slack](https://slack.com/)
  * Please use the following [link](https://join.slack.com/t/lins-lab-workspace/shared_invite/zt-210e8tar5-iVwexFvM197GjD09yE8FWQ) to join our space. 
  Please try to avoid using a web slack service, i.e. download Slack and open it during your working hours.
* Group calendar
  * Ph.D. students have *7 vacation days per calendar year* (in addition to the weekends and public holidays), and please send a request email to Songmei ZHU and cc PI for approval. The count will be renewed by the last day of March.
* PI's public calendar
  * You can use the following [calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=39ab00q03t28msbmsc9cbjd3ns@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia/Hong_Kong) to check the PI's (incomplete) availability.
  * You can use it to identify an open time slot.
      * Ideally, please send an invite to *itamtao@gmail.com*.
      * If it is urgent, then you may also walk into the PI's office (in addition to the regular weekly meeting).
* [Zotero: your personal research assistant](https://www.zotero.org/). Please check some of our [tips](https://github.com/LINs-lab/lab_internal_guides/blob/main/zotero_tips.md) here.
* VPN setup
  * Westlake internal: please ask Songmei ZHU for help in case of any doubts.
  * Oversea

## Key Tools
Mastering the following **two key tools** at LINs Lab:

* Git and GitHub
  * Git and Github will be our main collaboration platforms, thanks to their advances in version control.
  * Some tutorials:
    * [Git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
    * [A Tutorial for Git and GitHub](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:ff780599-d5e2-4d05-b923-1c333cbf2842/A%20Tutorial%20for%20GitHub.pdf)
