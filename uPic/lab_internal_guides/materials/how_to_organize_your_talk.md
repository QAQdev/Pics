## Outline

Organizing your talk with an OUTLINE slide?

I couldn't think of a weaker way of starting presentation with an outline!

Instead, start the presentation by explaining
> WHY SHOULD THEY CARE?

Describe why the problem is important, interesting, and challenging.

## Menu. Not outline

After motivating your talk, show a MENU slide that consists of two or three Entrée (topics that you want to cover in your talk).

Why? because the menu provides an easy way to navigate your talk.

## Tell them what you are going to say

Present all the Entrée options, then highlight the first one (and don't forget to de-emphasize the remaining ones).

This helps people know where are we heading to.

## Say it

Now you have set the stage. Just say it!

Here you can use as many slides as you want to introduce the first Entrée.

## Tell them what you've said

Next, after finishing the first part, zoom back out to the *same* menu slide.

* Summarize what you've just said
* Explain why we need to check out second Entrée (remember to emphasize/de-emphasize different Entrées)

Then repeat the 3-steps.

## Final slide

Do NOT show a meaningless "thank you slide".

At the end of your talk, bring back your MENU slide so that people can order (aka asking good questions) easily.
