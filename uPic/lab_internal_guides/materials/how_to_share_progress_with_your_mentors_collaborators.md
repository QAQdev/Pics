## Design: Why do we want do this experiment?

Plz treat your mentors as goldfishes.
Remind them WHY you did a particular experiment or implement a particular thing.
This will provide the contexts for them to help interpret the results and steer the direction of your research.

## Hypothesis: What do we expect to see?

Before showing your results, comment on what should have happened (if everything is correct)?

## Observation: What did we see?

Show the (failed) results. Don't just say "It doesn't work."
Describe HOW it fails.

## Interpretation: Is this expected/working?

After showing your results, comment on how do the results align with or deviate from your expectations.

## Visualization: Any better ways to see the results?

Seeing the results with a good visualization helps deepen our understanding and spot the issues.

## Actionable next steps: What steps would you do?

Remember to proactively propose the next steps so that we can make progress on the project.
Remember that you are the main DRIVER of the project.
Don't just wait for instructions.
