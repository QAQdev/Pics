## Track the people, not the papers

There are far fewer key people who are driving the field forward than the number of papers. Check out who the authors are when you read papers. Overtime you will recognize the important ones.

## Read papers with good related work

A good related work section saves you so much time by providing a clear, organized view for prior work.

Side note: Please save others' time by writing a good related work

## Organize the papers

Don't read papers individually.
Think about how are they related (similar in some aspects, but different in others).
It often helps to build a table with columns specifying ATTRIBUTES.

With this table, reading new papers becomes easy (just add more rows).

## Avoid reading the paper

Instead of spending time reading the actual paper, find resources that are much easier to digest, e.g., a talk, a youtube video, teaser results, introductory video, or an overview figure.

Very often understanding the gist of the paper is all you need.

## Read with a purpose

Before investing time on reading a paper, think about WHY you are reading it.
Are you reading for the experimental setup, the organization, the story, the style, the method, or the visualization?

You almost never need to read a paper from top to bottom.

## Identify the trend

Use your favorite tools to find what's hot/trendy, e.g.,

## A couple of points to add to this wonderful thread

1. Use Google Scholar to follow most frequently authors. Today almost everyone has an (automatic) profile. Also, follow the key publications.
2. To reduce your time searching for publications in conferences/journals use multi-keyword highlighter addon (for e.g., <https://is.gd/2lNdE1>) and add multiple keywords related to your literature review (e.g., educational technologies, emotional labor, emotional regulation).
3. Try to cover those papers that are sweeping surveys (not quant surveys, but broad review papers on the topic; for eg., <https://is.gd/39lleZ>). They give you birds-eye view of the topic/field. It is especially useful, if you are looking outside your field.
4. Don't start literature review at the last moment. Keep dumping the papers into a folder or a note. When you have free time, just give it a brief read and write a small summary of 50-100 words. This summary should only talk about how the paper is useful for your study.
