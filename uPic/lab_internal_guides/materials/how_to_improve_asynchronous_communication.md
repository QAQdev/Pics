## One topic at a time

## Inline response

✅ Writing replies below each topic (inline reply)

## Inline content

✅ Embed the content inline.

## Async sharing before sync meeting

❌ Describe your work, show results during the meeting.

✅ Summarize your work/results and send them for early feedback before the meeting. Make the best use of your favorite collaborative document platforms.

## Actionable next steps after a sync meeting

❌ Just talked. Brainstormed multiple ideas. Created a bunch of tasks.

✅ Decide WHO to do WHAT by WHEN.

## Give others control when setting up meetings

❌ When will you be available next week?

✅ I am available in the following time slots. When will work best for you? Use calendar tools (calendly, google calendar) to avoid back and forth discussions.

## Agenda, agenda, agenda

❌ Let's hop on a call and chat next week.

✅ Send clear meeting agenda with allocated time.
