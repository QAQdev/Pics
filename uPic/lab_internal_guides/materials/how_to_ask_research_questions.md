## Why should I (or someone else) care?

What will the field change with your work? This helps remind students of finding their core motivation of the work.

## When will you use it?

Contextualizing your research work with practical applications helps identify potentially unrealistic constraints/assumptions.

## What other people have done and why they are not satisfactory?

If existing methods work well already, why do you need to work on this research project?

## Which is the closest related work and how does yours differ?

Articulate the core novelty of your work.

## How did you know it is working (better than prior work)?

Are all the claims validated? Are the experiments fair? Are the results representative for the application domains?

## What would you do if you have another 3 months?

Think about how to maximally strengthen the work with a specific time budget.
