# How to communicate clearly?

From this [twitter](https://twitter.com/jbhuang0604/status/1520615196498214913).

Majority of our time goes into emails, slack messages, and loads of meetings.

Yet, as a student, no one taught me how to communicate well. (I must have annoyed a lot of people along the way ...ðŸ˜¬)

Here is a template for organizing your message.

---

## (1) What?

What's your key point? Please don't tell a convoluted story that graaaadually leads to your main point. Ain't nobody got time for that!

ðŸ‘‰ Identify your main message and put them up front.

## (2) So What?

Why is it relevant or important for your work/project/team? Why should your audience care?

ðŸ‘‰ Tell me why?

## (3) Now What?

What are the *actionable* steps next?
e.g., Set up another meeting? Ask for feedback? Outline a plan for a new task?

ðŸ‘‰ Call for specific action!

## Example: Research

1. What?
    * Here are the results of a toy problem A.
2. So what?
    * This is important because the experiment helps us  study only problem A and not get distracted by problem B/C.
3. Now what?
    * I will move on to study problem B and C.

## Example: Opportunity

1. What?
    * I am interested in working with you.
2. So what?
    * I have relevant skills, experiences, and specific ideas on how to extend your recent work X to Y and Z.
3. Now what?
    * When would you be available so I can present these specific directions?
