## Find a different dimension

Just learn a cool idea from others?
Think about how you could extend it to another dimension.

Ex: Text / audio / image / video / graph

## Relax assumptions

Identify the underlying assumptions of existing work and try relaxing them to make it work in more unconstrained settings.

## Make more assumptions

Take a general approach and tailor it to your SPECIFIC problem.
You can then leverage all the domain knowledge (i.e., make more assumptions) to improve the method.

## Combine two ideas/problems

"To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism. To steal from many is research." - Wilson Mizner

## Grab a powerful hammer and find all the nails

Pay attention to new emerging tools in the community.
Apply and adapt them on your problem.

## Add an adjective

Given an existing idea X, add an adjective to make it

- slow -> fast
- batch -> online
- sensitive -> robust
- centralized -> distributed
- single-step -> progressive
- single-level -> hierarchical
- fixed -> adaptive, sth-aware
- data-hungry -> data-efficient
and so on

## Stress test the state-of-the-art

Don't simply run on the fixed, boring benchmark datasets.
Try it out on diverse, unconstrained examples and see how it fails.
It's a great way to identify limitations of existing work.
This is where your work can fill the gap.
