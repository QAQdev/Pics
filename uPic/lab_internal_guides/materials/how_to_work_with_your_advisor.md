## Know the Role of Your Advisor

Your advisor is an *INPUT-OUPUT MACHINE*.

You throw them sth in and get sth out.

* ❌ In-only: You do everything and report final results.
* ❌ Out-only: You do everything they told you to do.
* ✅ In&out: You get frequent and valuable guidance.

## Show Your Work

How do you get the best guidance from your advisor?

* ❌ Show your success only!
* ✅ Show your work!

Describe the detailed process you went through, the reasoning you, the methodology you adopt, and the interpretations of the results you got.

## Present Failures

* ❌ "It doesn't work."
* ✅ "Here is HOW it fails. I feed X but somehow did not get Y. I believe the core issues lie in steps Z and W. I have ruled out W as the cause. Next, I will design experiments to isolate the step Z."

## Leverage Async Discussions

* ❌ Wait for weekly meeting to present everything.
* ✅ Send frequent and concise updates along the way.

Keep your advisor engaged and excited about your research.

## Provide Contexts

Your advisor will forget everything you discuss the moment you step out the door.

* 👉 Treat your advisor as goldfish. Always provide high-level contexts first.
* 👉  Maintain meeting minutes that everyone agrees upon so you have consistent guidance.

## Set Expectation

* ❌ No plan/timeline. Just try to finish everything as soon as possible.
* ✅ Set realistic timeline for your research progress. Tell your advisor you will do what by when.
